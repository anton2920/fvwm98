# fvwm98

fvwm98 is a window manager with Windows 98 look and feel. This repository contains a port of this window manager to a modern Unix running on the `amd64` architecture.

Most of the compiler warnings were fixed, which in turn fixed a lot of bugs and faults. Also [configure.in](configure.in) file was reworked to enable build with a modern `clang`. Tested on FreeBSD 13+ and Debian 12.

My personal configuration file: [.fvwm95rc](sample.fvwmrc/anton2920.fvwm95rc).

Original README is available [README.hector](README.hector). Original source code could be found at [fvwm98_2.0.43b.orig.tgz](https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/fvwm95/fvwm98/2.0.43b/fvwm98_2.0.43b.orig.tgz).
