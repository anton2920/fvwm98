This is version 0.4 of FvwmIconMan, an icon manager modeled roughly on 
TWM's icon manager.

It has been tested under linux, solaris, OSF/1 3.0, and hp-ux 9.01. The latest
changes I made haven't been tested under sunos4, as I no longer have access to 
a sunos4 machine, but I believe they should work. There has been a lot of
changes since version 0.2, so as always, there is potential for bugs. In the
likely event that someone finds one, please let me know.

The file fvwm.patch is a patch to fvwm2.0.41 which modifies the behavior of
the Focus function so that it is (IMHO) more pleasant to use. Read the patch
file and the FvwmIconMan man page for more information.

The included man page gives some examples of how to configure FvwmIconMan, and
a description of what it is, so I won't repeat it here.

If something needs to be tweaked to make this more portable, then feel free
to inform me, and I would greatly appreciate any suggestions towards
improvement.

I realize that the syntax for setting options is different from that used by
other modules.

I have discontinued support for fvwm 1. If you need to compile it for
that version of fvwm, send me mail, and I'll tell you how. The version of
FvwmIconMan included in the fvwm 2.0 distribution WILL NOT run under fvwm 1.

The latest up to date version can be found in ftp://mahler.cs.arizona.edu/pub,
if it's not in the fvwm distribution.
